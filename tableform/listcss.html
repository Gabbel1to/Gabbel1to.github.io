            <li>Gutenberg develops movable type (1450s)</li>
            <li>Linotype is introduced (1890s)</li>
            <li>Photocomposition catches on (1950s)</li>
            <li>Type goes digital (1980s)</li>

                <dd>Line-casting allowed type to be selected, used, then recirculated  into the machine automatically. <br>
                    This advance increased the speed of   typesetting and printing dramatically.

            <dt>Photocomposition</dt>
                <dd>Typefaces are stored on film then projected onto photo-sensitive  paper. <br>
                    Lenses adjust the size of the type.

                <p>
                    Digital typefaces store the outline of the font shape in a format such as Postscript. <br>
                    The outline may be scaled to any size for output.

                <dd>
                <p>
                    Postscript emerged as a standard due to its support of graphics and its early support on <br>
                    the Macintosh computer and Apple laser printer.
